# Privacy Policy

Dexter imploys the use of the Google Data V3 API to get information from YouTube, such as getting song names via their URLs.

As such, the bot requires a privacy policy (which is this haha).

## What we require from the bot maintainer:

- YouTube read privilages, to get information of YouTube videos that are on the platform - though we don't stream any videos through the API, as it is purely for metadata on videos.

This data api isn't used for anything else, and since Dexter is all opensource, you're free to look at where the API has endpoints connected to.

### Do note:

Some older versions may require a Google Sheets scope. This is to modify the, now depricated, GreetFur spreadsheet.
